# Day 0

This is just me figuring out different bits and pieces.

First things first, I'm learning Common Lisp? Wikipedia tells me it's the most
standardized language specification and I presume I can learn other dialects
quite easily if I get up to speed on (what feels like) the deep end first.
I just installed `sbcl` and am running scripts with `sbcl --script <filename>.lisp`


## The Gotchas:
 - It's tricky to remember to infix-notation everything
 - I should probably start using the REPL of `sbcl` soon instead of relying on
     files
 - `(princ (+ 1 2 3))` prints, but `(terpri)` is needed to have nice end of
     lines.
