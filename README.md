# Lisp!

I've heard enough about Lisp to be intrigued by what all these super smart
people are writing in that I want to learn it! I'm going to use this to try
keep up with Advent of Code 2021 and document my day learnings in numbered
directories. This is not a guide. If anything, it should probably be an
anti-pattern of how to approach learning Lisp!
